# RepoScopeAgent

**RepoScopeAgent** is an intelligent, LLM-driven tool built with the [Sentient Agent Framework](https://github.com/sentient-agi/Sentient-Agent-Framework) to streamline GitHub repository analysis. It empowers developers to explore, summarize, and compare open-source projects through a conversational chat interface, ideal for platforms like sentient.xyz. By automating tasks like code summarization, version diffing, pattern searching, and issue detection, it saves time and simplifies complex workflows.
Here‚Äôs a tightened-up version with your new points folded in naturally:


## Problem It Solves

The majority of users exploring tools like this are developers ‚Äî most come looking for **coding-related insights**. But the process is often messy:

* **Limitations of Standard LLMs**: Traditional models like ChatGPT can only **crawl a repo‚Äôs front page** ‚Äî they can‚Äôt **deep dive into the full codebase**. That means their answers often lack context, clarity, and accuracy when analyzing or summarizing repositories.
* **Time-Consuming Manual Analysis**: Cloning repositories, running linters, or comparing versions manually is tedious and error-prone.
* **Complex Code Insights**: Identifying code patterns, function calls, or potential issues requires specialized tools and expertise.
* **Version Comparison Challenges**: Understanding changes between repository versions (e.g., new features, bug fixes) involves complex Git commands.
* **Security and Reliability Concerns**: Assessing whether a repository is secure or trustworthy requires deep inspection of code and licenses.


**RepoScopeAgent** addresses these by:
- **Automating Analysis**: Uses an LLM (Qwen-72B) to interpret natural language queries and deliver insights like summaries, security assessments, and code metrics.
- **Simplifying Version Diffs**: Compares repository versions (e.g., `v1.0.0` vs `v2.0.0`) with clear tables showing added/removed lines.
- **Streamlining Code Inspection**: Finds patterns (e.g., `try-except`), counts lines, and detects issues using tools like pylint.
- **Ensuring Reliability**: Analyzes licenses and code for malware, providing confidence in using open-source projects.
- **Conversational Interface**: Supports flexible, natural language queries (e.g., ‚ÄúIs pallets/flask secure?‚Äù) for a seamless user experience on sentient.xyz.

## Features

- **Repository Analysis**: Summarizes repository contents, structure, and security (e.g., `is github.com/pallets/flask secure`).
- **Version Diffing**: Compares two versions of a repository to highlight file changes (e.g., `diff github.com/pallets/flask v1.0.0 v2.0.0`).
- **Code Pattern Search**: Identifies specific patterns like `try-except` or function calls (e.g., `find try-except in pallets/flask`).
- **Code Issue Detection**: Detects potential issues using pylint (e.g., `find issues in pallets/flask`).
- **Line and File Counting**: Counts lines of code and files by type (e.g., `how many lines of code in pallets/flask`).
- **Function Call Tracing**: Traces function calls across a repository (e.g., `trace route in pallets/flask`).
- **Cross-Repository Comparison**: Compares function implementations across multiple repositories (e.g., `compare route in pallets/flask and tiangolo/fastapi`).
- **Default Repository Setting**: Sets a default repository for repeated analysis (e.g., `set default github.com/pallets/flask`).
- **LLM-Driven Queries**: Handles natural language inputs for flexible, user-friendly interactions.
- **Clean, Tabulated Output**: Delivers Markdown-formatted tables for readability in chat interfaces.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- SQLite
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/reposcopeagent.git
   cd reposcopeagent
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Required packages:
   - `aiohttp`
   - `sentence-transformers`
   - `faiss-cpu`
   - `pygit2`

   ```
   The server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/assist`.

5. **Test the Agent**:
   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```
   This executes a test suite and starts an interactive chat session.

### Requirements File
Create a `requirements.txt` with:
```
aiohttp
sentence-transformers
faiss-cpu
pygit2
pylint
```

## Usage

Run `test.py` to execute the test suite or interact via the chat interface.
